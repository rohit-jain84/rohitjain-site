## Work History

### Senior Tech Lead Software Engineer
**Entegral, Remote - Knysna, South Africa** | *2022-03 - 2024-12*

- Owned the v1->v2 modernization of a latency-plagued platform; set the technical vision, roadmap, and guardrails tied to SLOs and customer outcomes.
- Partnered across engineering and product teams to lead cross-stack architecture (.NET 6 services on AWS); made critical, business-first trade-offs (e.g., DynamoDB vs. Aurora/Postgres) that protected feature velocity while de-risking delivery.
- Root-caused performance regressions: identified Redis misuse (scatter/gather, client-side joins) as the bottleneck; redesigned cache keys/data shapes and TTL policies, materially improving p95/p99 and stability.
- Repaired DynamoDB anti-patterns: shifted from normalized, multi-table reads to access-pattern-first single-table modeling (GSIs/LSIs) to eliminate N-way reads and in-code joins; simplified hot paths.
- Championed a data-driven product initiative to create an Automated Valuation Model (AVM); built a prototype using a regression model (e.g., XGBoost) on property feature data (size, location) to predict market values, proving the feasibility of a new potential revenue stream.

**Tech Stack:** C#, .NET 6, React, AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB single-table, S3, CloudWatch), Redis

### CTO & Principal Architect (Founder) (Concurrent Entrepreneurial Venture)
**Investello** | *2016-07 - 2025-10*
*(part-time alongside full-time roles until Dec 2024; full-time Jan–Oct 2025)*

- Architected and scaled a value-investing SaaS platform from 0 to 1, achieving 50,000+ registered users and ₹10 Lakh ARR by building a differentiated product with automated valuation engines and high-performance stock screeners.
- Designed and evolved the distributed data platform with scheduled ingestion pipelines, idempotent background workers, and resilient APIs; scaled a manual 100-stock pilot into automated daily/quarterly/annual loads processing 500K+ records via provider APIs, with scheduling, retries, and integrity checks ensuring 99.9% data freshness.
- Built an AI-powered earnings report analyzer using Azure Blob Storage, Azure Functions, and Semantic Kernel to parse long-form earnings PDFs into structured summaries, sentiment, and key metrics, thus providing users with qualitative context beyond raw quantitative data.
- After leaving Entegral in Dec 2024, worked full-time on Investello from Jan–Oct 2025 to pursue product–market fit; when it did not reach the traction targets I'd set, I wrapped up active development and decided to return to a full-time staff/principal engineering role in a larger product organization.

**Tech Stack:** C#, ASP.Net Core, Azure (App Services, SQL, Blob, OpenAI Service), Semantic Kernel

- **Asharqiya Chamber of Commerce (Saudi Arabia):** Architected and led the development of a secure membership portal using .NET Core and SQL Server, implementing configurable workflows, RBAC, and robust auditing to meet enterprise requirements.
- **IDrive (USA) - Enterprise Backup Solution:** Designed and built high-reliability backup/restore services in C# with MongoDB and AWS S3, engineering for data integrity with checksums, resumable uploads, and idempotent operations.
- **GrantEd (USA) - Scholarship Matching Platform:** Developed a sophisticated rules and matching engine in .NET with PostgreSQL, designing scalable schemas and asynchronous notification queues to handle complex eligibility logic.

**Tech Stack:** C#, React, .Net Core, AWS, Azure, PostgreSQL, Mongo DB, SQL Server

- Led backend and cloud architecture on Azure (C#, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server; VMs/Cloud Services, Blob Storage, CDN); established code reviews and development standards for long-term maintainability.
- Drove execution as head of an 8-engineer team—ran Agile ceremonies, removed blockers, improved dev/deployment processes; partnered with CEO/marketing to prioritize the roadmap against business goals.

**Tech Stack:** C#, ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server, Azure (VMs/Cloud Services, Blob Storage, CDN)
